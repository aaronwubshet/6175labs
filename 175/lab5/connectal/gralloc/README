To compile the gralloc library:

1. cd <top of android build tree>
    (to build this tree, see: https://github.com/cambridgehackers/zynq-android4/wiki/ZynqAndroid4.1 )
2. set environment variables from that build tree:
    source ./build/envsetup.sh; lunch zedboard-userdebug
3. cd <gralloc library directory (the directory containing this README file)
4. Compile source:
    TOP=<top of android build tree> mm
    (Note that this will place the resulting library into the android build tree output directory,
     probably in the file: out/target/product/zedboard/system/lib/hw/gralloc.portal.so )

NOTE: the xilinx GLIBCXX libraries conflict with the gcc system libraries used by the GCC
   cross compiler (xilinx versions are bad).
   Because of this, the xilinx 'source xxxx' lines cannot be executed prior to compiling android.
