Tour of BSV objects
Double write
useful construction in BSV


The only thing that exists is a module
  register is the primitive module
  rules and methods are elements of a module

"=" is just naming (with types)
module <- (something that returns module)
"<-" is how you instantiate a module given the instructions to make that module

Interface is the type used for modules

Interface Adder;
  any required methods
endinterface

module first_module(Adder);
  required methods
    functions
  unique methods
    functions
  rules
    functions
endmodule
module  other_module(Adder);
  required methods
    functions
  unique methods
    functions
  rules
    functions

DOUBLE WRITE
shadow effects on write methods/rules
you cannot write to the same register twice within the same rule/method
  use separate rules/methods

Useful Types:
Maybe
Interface
Vector
Bit
Bool
